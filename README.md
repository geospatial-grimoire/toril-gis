# Toril GIS: The Source for Forgotten Realms Geospatial Data

The **Toril GIS** project, under the umbrella of [Geospatial Grimoire](https://geospatial-grimoire.com/), is creating a functional and easy-to-use geospatial database for the Forgotten Realms. By digitizing maps and lore using the free and open-source [QGIS software](https://www.qgis.org/), the project empowers Dungeon Masters and players to explore and visualize the Realms in exciting new ways. Users can create derivative products such as interactive maps, 3D models, and more, with multilingual support for map labels. Join us as we transcend the limitations of static maps and delve into the rich geospatial data of the Toril planet! 

**Note**: This project is under active development, and content updates will be released soon—anticipated around early 2025. Stay tuned for more!
